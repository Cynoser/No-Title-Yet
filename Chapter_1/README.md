# Chapter 1: Heeh

 My Name Is NonNameYet, I Had Been Working At A 'BlahBlahBlah Organization' For Almost Fifteen-Years Since I Was Twenties Years Old, Thus I'm Thirty-Fifth Years Old This Year.

 Like Always, I'm Completing The Organization's Data Management For This Month, And Last Week The 'BlahBlahBlah Country's President' Changed The 'BlahBlahBlah Organization's CEO' TO Some Unknown Person That I Had Never Heard Before, It's A Woman By The Way. The Former's CEO Was Living Happily At Some Island, Is What I Heard And I Don't Care Abot It Cause It Not Even My Problems.

  Anywhere... Back To Work. While I 'Were' Sorting The Organization's Data, The Current CEO, Which I Don't Know Would Come And See Me At My Workplace. She Wore A 'Very Very Very' Common Office Suit. Lost My Hope In 'Something', But In The Bright Side, I Got To See The So Called 'Beautiful Face', That Had Been Rumoured All Around The Organizations', Which I Should Tell It's True That She Is 'Beautiful' Woman I Had Ever Seen.

  Back To Business, She ( I Really Don't Know Her Name [YET] ) Come To Me And Look At Me With A.... 'Sternfull' Look ( At least Not The Scornfull ), And..

  " Hey You " ( Well That Really Not Expected Way Of Addressing Someone ).
  I Look At Her, Stand, And Gave A Salute.
  " Yes! Ma'am!! "
  Oh Yeah... How Did I Know She The CEO? Cause She Wore The Badge Of A CEO... Damnit!! I Want Too!!
  " Starting Today, You Fired. Go To my Office And Ready To Sign The Documents ", She Said And Leave From The Workplace, Which Make Me Speechless... I Mean Maybe She My New CEO That Why She Doesn't Know About My Contract, The One That I Would'nt Fired At least For Twenties Years Of Work Unless I Quit. Well Whatever... I Wanted To Take A Break Anywhere And Start Living Like A 'BOSS'.

  After My Break, I'm Currently At The Front Of My CEO's Office. I Don't Wanted To Get My Hope High, But When I Were In My Break, I Think That Maybe She Wanted To Do 'That'. Well Let's Just Forget About My Unreal Imagination, And Focus.

  Before I Knock The Door, I Want To Said That My CEO's Voice Is Super Beautiful!!

  Now, I'm Knocking The Door.
  "Umm.. Miss CEO, Can I Came In? This Is Me The One You Had Me Fired And Want To Sign The Documents And I Want To Said That 'BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH YADA YADA YADA TELLA LALA' And That's Why You Should Never Use The Bathrooms Number 7 At Floor 8. ".
  WOW I Really Said That.
  " Just Come In!!! I Had Said That 10 Minutes Ago!! "
  Oh.My.My.My.My.My..... I Really Make Her Mad Like Literally 'Mad'.

  "Oppss... I'm Really Sorry Ma'am " , I Opened The Door And See Her Sitting At The CEO Place... And Her Buttons Is OPENED??!!, Darn It Does My 'Imagination' Is Happening??!! To Me?? A Thirty-Fifth Years Old 'Virgin'??!! Nooooooo~~~ I'm Not Ready 'Yet'.

  " Ughh... Just Sat Down, And Sign This Documents "
  A Marriage Documents??!!
  Umm.. NOPE It Not A Marriage Documents
  I Sat Down, And Read Every Single Things, And Sign Them Off When It's Correct.

  " Here You Go " I Said It And Hand Over The Documents.

  She Check It, And Smiles.

  " Congratulations. Mister NonNameYet, You Had Officially Out From This Organization, Thank You For Your Contributions In All This Years... "
  " Ohh Don't Forgot My Name The CEO Of 'BlahBlahBlah' Organization, Miss IMMANONAMEYET "
  She Said And Gave A Hand..

  I Grab Her Hand And Shook It Properly, Then I Remember In The 'Royal Etiquette's Where They Kiss The Hand', Thus I Slightly Kiss Her Hand, And Said, " Ofcourse, I Would'nt forget My Lady... " And Quickly Get Out From The Door.

  Now... To Think How And What Should I Told My Mom About The Event...
  Oh Well, I Think Off Whatever I Could Until I Arrived At My 'So Long 'Only' Home' ( Which Is My Mom House )

                                      ****

POV: The 'BlahBlahBlah' Organization's CEO

 I'm IMMANONAMEYET, I'm Thirty-Two Years Old This Years.
 I Became A CEO For Only A Single Reasons, And That Is To Make The Man Whose Had Make The Awesome Game In The World, When He Was Only Seventeen Years Old, To Opened Back The Game Server!! .

 It's Started When I Was Fourteen Years Old Cute Teen Girl, That Time I Really Bored, Every Game That I Played Ended Up In Completely Finished, Until... I Found The New Pre-Realesed Game That Still In Beta.
 I Played The Game For Almost Three Years, And I Never Get Bored And To My Suprise, The Game Was Made By Just A Single Person That Still Looking For A Job.

 When He Got The Job, Every Player's That Played The Game Was Happy But At The Same Time Was Sad Because Their Favourite Game Would Be Closed.

 However, He Left A Note, That If He Was Fired Or Had No Job, He Would Opened The Game Again, And Updated It To Best Gameplay Ever.

 Thus I Wait, But That Doesn't Make Me Feel Great. Then I Come Up With A Nice idea... And That Is To Be His Boss And Fired Him!!

 At First I Was In Difficult As I Don't Know Where He Was Working At And What Is His Identity.

 But That Is now In The Past, I Finally Found Him And Fired Him!!!

 To My Excitment, I Had Go To His Office, And Fired Him Right Away. I Forgot That I Can Just Called Him By Phone.

 I Got Back TO My Office, And Sat And Wait For Him...

 It's Had Been Almost Two Hours, What He Taking So Long For?? Then I Heard His Voice, And Told Him To Get Inside, And To My Dismayed, He Just Blabling Nonsense. It Took About Ten Minutes.

 I Yelled At Him To Get Inside, And Let Him Sat Down, And Sign The Documents.

 It Took A While, And I Already Excited That I Forgot About Manners And Just Gave My Hand TO Him To Shook And I even Smile!!

 He Took My Hand And Gave A Slight Handshake, Then To My Bewildred, He Kiss My Hand!! Then Ran Away!!

 I Just Stand There With A Hot Feeling At My Face... And Felt Something Wrong With Me.
 But Whatever, I Just Had TO Wait... But Wait A Secod, Does He Remember About The Game He Had Make??!!

                                          ****
